# Stress Reliver - Snake

Classic Snake: grid movement, growing snake, food spawn, score, game-over, restart.

## Run
1. Open `/Users/anask/Documents/New project/index.html` in a browser.
2. Or start a dev server:
```bash
cd "/Users/anask/Documents/New project"
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## Controls
- Arrow keys or WASD to move.
- Space to pause/resume.
- R to restart.

## Manual checklist
1. Snake grows when eating food; score increments.
2. Game ends on wall or self-collision.
3. Pause/resume works.
4. Restart resets game and score.
5. On-screen controls respond on small screens.
